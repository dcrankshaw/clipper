### Developing Clipper

Development of Clipper is coordinated through GitHub.

To get started, clone the [repository](https://github.com/ucbrise/clipper)
including submodules:

```console
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ucbrise/clipper.git
```

> If you've already cloned the repository at this point without the submodules,
> you can include them by running `git submodule update --init --recursive` in
> the Clipper repo.

__Build Dependencies:__

+ Boost >= 1.60
+ cmake >= 3.2
+ zeromq >= 4.1.6
+ hiredis
+ libev
+ redis-server >= 3.2


__Building Clipper:__

First generate the CMake files with `./configure`. This generates an out-of-source build directory called `debug`.
Go into this directory and then run `make` to actually
compile the code. You should only need to re-run the configuration script if you change one of the `CMakeLists.txt` files.
To build for release, run `./configure --release` which generates the `release` build directory instead of debug.
If you want to clean everything up, you can run `./configure --cleanup` (if you get tired of being prompted, you can run `./configure --cleanup-quiet` to force cleanup without prompting).


{{% notice note %}}
Redis must be installed and on your path to run both the query REST frontend and the unit-tests.
You can test this with `redis-server --version`.
{{% /notice %}}

For example:

```console
cd $CLIPPER_ROOT_DIR
./configure
cd debug
make

# write some code and compile it
make

# build and run unit tests with googletest
../bin/run_unittests.sh

# build and then start the query REST frontend
../bin/start_clipper.sh
```

Clipper has been tested on OSX 10.11, 10.12, and on Debian stretch/sid and Ubuntu 12.04 and 16.04. It does not support Windows.

To file a bug or request a feature, please file a GitHub issue. Pull requests are welcome.

Our mailing list is <clipper-dev@googlegroups.com>. For more information about the project, please contact Dan Crankshaw (<crankshaw@cs.berkeley.edu>).

Development planning and progress is tracked with the [Clipper Jira](https://clipper.atlassian.net/projects/CLIPPER/issues).
